I really like the Raspberry Pi and bought almost every model so far. One is driving my [3d printer]({% post_url 2018-03-02-octoprint-psucontrol %}), one is playing non stop on [RecalBox](https://www.recalbox.com/),
one is [dead](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/lYf9HK-rI1s/maxresdefault.jpg#fancy) and
the last one is a brand new newcomer from the US, the Raspberry Pi 4.
This model is not widely available in Singapore or is really overpriced so I searched on Amazon US and found
a great kit: [Canakit](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07VYC6S56/ref=ppx_od_dt_b_asin_title_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1).

Now what? It's time to setup the new ultimate home server! The tasks I will assign to my new beloved Pi are:

- handle my home network (DNS IPv4 and IPv6)
- docker everywhere to avoid messing up the host, ease maintenance and limit the attack surface
- pi-hole to filter the Internet
- a vpn and torrent client
- samba to expose few shares (thanks to the gigabit network interface)
- home assistant / red node / mosquitto... for all my home automation stuff
- dozen of .Net core images because it can

## Warm up

Let's start with the standard setup. I download the new Raspbian Buster lite image and use Etcher to flash
a 64GB Sandisk Extreme MicroSD card. I took the fastest card I had but I already know it will be the bottleneck.
I will probably try to boot from a SSD drive later (through USB) but
it's [not supported](https://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewtopic.php?t=243995) for now.

As I will start the Raspberry Pi headless, I create a simple empty `ssh` file in the root directory
of the boot partition to enable the SSH server. I plug the Pi and search for the IP in my router lease table.

Once the IP is found, I connect to the Raspberry Pi using the default credentials (`pi / raspberry`)
and we can start to be serious.

## Initial configuration

Let's start by finishing the Raspberry Pi initial configuration. I launch a simple
`apt update && apt upgrade` and once the system is up to date, I launch `sudo raspi-config`
and execute the following changes:

- Set the hostname to `pisin`
- Change the locale to `en_SG.UTF-8 UTF-8` (let's live locale)
- Change the timezone to `Asia/Singapore` (let's be locale v2)
- Expand the filsystem to use the whole SD Card (in advanced options)
- And finally reboot as proposed

### Create a new user

I create a new user account

```shell
$ sudo su

-- Store our new user in a variable
# export NEWUSER=myuser

-- Create a new user
# adduser --gecos "" ${NEWUSER}

-- Add the user to some groups (to allow sudo and viewing logs)
# adduser ${NEWUSER} sudo
# adduser ${NEWUSER} adm

-- Allow sudo without asking the password
# tee /etc/sudoers.d/010_${NEWUSER}-nopasswd > /dev/null << EOF
${NEWUSER} ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD:ALL
EOF
```

### Remove pi account and system hardening

Let's try to login using the new account. Once logged, I remove the old `pi` account, deactivate direct root login
and restrict SSH authentication to public keys only.

```shell
-- Add our SSH public key
$ mkdir .ssh
$ tee .ssh/authorized_keys > /dev/null << "EOF"
ssh-rsa AAAABC  [MY PUBLIC KEY]
EOF

$ sudo su

-- Remove old pi account
# deluser pi
# rm -fR /home/pi
# rm /etc/sudoers.d/010_pi-nopasswd

-- Deactivate root direct login
# passwd -dl root

-- Deactivate password authentication using ssh
# sed -i 's/#PasswordAuthentication yes/PasswordAuthentication no/g' /etc/ssh/sshd_config
# systemctl restart ssh
```

Before closing the existing SSH session, I try to login from another terminal using my public key and ensure I can get the root privileges.

### Install simple MTA

Even in 2019, it's still useful to receive mails. I configure a simple MTA just in case.

```shell
# export MTA_DOMAIN=ssl0.ovh.net
# export MTA_USER=sender@domain.tld
# export MTA_PASSWORD=password
# export RECIPIENT=recipient@domain.tld

# apt install msmtp-mta
# tee /etc/msmtprc > /dev/null << EOF
account default
auth on
host ${MTA_DOMAIN}
port 587
user ${MTA_USER}
from ${MTA_USER}
password ${MTA_PASSWORD}
tls on
tls_starttls on
tls_certcheck on
tls_trust_file /etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt
aliases /etc/aliases
EOF

# echo "default: ${RECIPIENT}" >> /etc/aliases
# newaliases
```

Once configured, I test the configuration with the command `echo "Test" | sendmail recipient@domain.tld`
and ensure I receive the message (most probably in the spam folder)
