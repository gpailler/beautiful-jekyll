I really like the Raspberry Pi and bought almost every model so far. One is driving my [3d printer]({% post_url 2018-03-02-octoprint-psucontrol %}), another one is playing non stop on [RecalBox](https://www.recalbox.com/), the first one is [dead](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/lYf9HK-rI1s/maxresdefault.jpg#fancy) (it's not mine :wink:) and the last one in the family is the brand new Raspberry Pi 4.
This model is not available in Singapore or is sold twice the price so I ended up by buying a nice [Canakit](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07VYC6S56/ref=ppx_od_dt_b_asin_title_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1) on Amazon US.

Now what? It's time to setup the new ultimate home server! The tasks I would like to assign to my new beloved Pi are:

- [handle my home network (IPv4 and IPv6)]({% post_url 2019-10-07-pi4-part2 %})
- [docker everywhere]({% post_url 2019-10-08-pi4-part3 %}) to avoid messing up the host, ease the maintenance and limit the attack surface
- [pi-hole to filter the Internet]({% post_url 2019-10-13-pi4-part4 %})
- [a vpn and torrent client]({% post_url 2019-10-20-pi4-part5 %})
- nginx as a web frontend for the containers + let's encrypt
- samba to expose few shares (thanks to the gigabit network interface)
- home assistant / red node / mosquitto... for all my home automation stuff
- dozen of .Net core images because it can

## Warm up

Let's start with the initial setup. I download the new [Raspbian Buster lite](https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/raspbian/) image and use [Etcher](https://www.balena.io/etcher/) to flash a 64GB Sandisk Extreme MicroSD card. I took the fastest card I had but I already know it will be the bottleneck.
I will probably try to boot from a SSD drive later (through USB) but it's [unsupported](https://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewtopic.php?t=243995) for now.

As I want to start the Raspberry Pi headless, I create a simple empty `ssh` file in the root directory of the boot partition to enable the SSH server. I plug the Pi and search for the assigned IP in my router DHCP lease table.

Once I got the IP, I connect to the Raspberry Pi using the default credentials (`pi / raspberry`).

## Initial configuration

Let's start by finishing the Raspberry Pi configuration. I launch a simple `apt update && apt upgrade` and once the system is up to date, I launch `sudo raspi-config` and execute the following changes:

- Set the hostname to `pisin`
- Change the locale to `en_SG.UTF-8 UTF-8`
- Change the timezone to `Asia/Singapore`
- Expand the filesystem to use the whole SD Card (in advanced options)
- And finally reboot

### Create a new user

It's time to create our standard user account

```console
$ sudo su

-- Store our new user in a variable
# export NEWUSER=myuser

-- Create a new user
# adduser --gecos "" ${NEWUSER}

-- Add the user to some groups (to allow sudo and reading logs)
# adduser ${NEWUSER} sudo
# adduser ${NEWUSER} adm

-- Allow sudo without asking the user password
# tee /etc/sudoers.d/010_${NEWUSER}-nopasswd > /dev/null << EOF
${NEWUSER} ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD:ALL
EOF
```

### Remove pi account and improve system security

Let's try to login using the new account. Once logged, I remove the old `pi` account, deactivate root login and restrict SSH authentication to public keys only.

```console
-- Add our SSH public key
$ mkdir .ssh
$ tee .ssh/authorized_keys > /dev/null << "EOF"
ssh-rsa AAAABC[MY PUBLIC KEY]
EOF

$ sudo su

-- Remove old pi account
# deluser pi
# rm -fR /home/pi
# rm /etc/sudoers.d/010_pi-nopasswd

-- Deactivate root login
# passwd -dl root

-- Deactivate SSH password authentication
# sed -i 's/#PasswordAuthentication yes/PasswordAuthentication no/g' /etc/ssh/sshd_config
# systemctl restart ssh
```

Before closing the existing SSH session, I try to login from another terminal using my public key and I check I can 'sudo' to get the root privileges.

## Extra configuration

### Install simple MTA

Even in 2019, it's still useful to receive mails. I configure a simple MTA just in case.

```console
# export MTA_DOMAIN=ssl0.ovh.net
# export MTA_USER=sender@domain.tld
# export MTA_PASSWORD=password
# export RECIPIENT=recipient@domain.tld

# apt install msmtp-mta
# tee /etc/msmtprc > /dev/null << EOF
account default
auth on
host ${MTA_DOMAIN}
port 587
user ${MTA_USER}
from ${MTA_USER}
password ${MTA_PASSWORD}
tls on
tls_starttls on
tls_certcheck on
tls_trust_file /etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt
aliases /etc/aliases
EOF

# echo "default: ${RECIPIENT}" >> /etc/aliases
# newaliases
```

Once configured, I test the configuration with the command `echo "Test" | sendmail recipient@domain.tld` and I wait for the mail  (most probably in the spams folder)

### Cleanup unused packages

Finally, I remove some useless packages from the Pi

```console
$ sudo apt-get remove avahi-daemon
$ sudo apt autoremove
```
