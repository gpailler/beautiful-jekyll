[Pi-Hole](https://pi-hole.net/) is a custom DNS server mainly used to block advertisements. Once installed, it acts as the standard DNS server for my whole network and I don't need to configure any adblock plugin on my devices.

Pi-Hole will be the default DNS server on my network but I will not use its DHCP capabilities. I will keep my original Dnsmasq instance for DHCP and as an upstream server for DNS resolution. This way, it's easier to revert to a configuration without Pi-Hole with few changes.

## Pi-Hole configuration

I start by creating a docker-compose.yml file with all the required options

```console
$ export PASSWORD=password
$ export HOST_IP4=192.168.1.2
$ export HOST_IP6=2404:e801:xxxx:xxxx::1681:2

$ mkdir /opt/docker/pihole
$ tee /opt/docker/pihole/docker-compose.yml > /dev/null << EOF
version: "3"

services:
  pihole:
    container_name: pihole
    image: pihole/pihole:latest
    ports:
      - '53:53/tcp'
      - '53:53/udp'
      - '80:80/tcp'
    environment:
      TZ: 'Asia/Singapore'
      WEBPASSWORD: '${PASSWORD}'
      DNS1: '172.17.0.1#5353'
      DNS2: 'no'
      ServerIP: '${HOST_IP4}'
      ServerIPv6: '${HOST_IP6}'
    volumes:
      - './config/pihole/:/etc/pihole/'
      - './config/dnsmasq.d/:/etc/dnsmasq.d/'
    dns:
      - 127.0.0.1 # Required for local names resolution
      - 1.1.1.1 # Required during startup when Pi-Hole is not fully started
    network_mode: "host"
    restart: unless-stopped
EOF
```

Then I modify the Pi-Hole's Dnsmasq configuration to force it to listen on all Docker interfaces and not only on eth0

```console
$ mkdir -p /opt/docker/pihole/config/dnsmasq.d/
$ tee /opt/docker/pihole/config/dnsmasq.d/10-docker.conf > /dev/null << "EOF"
interface=docker0
interface=br-*
EOF
```

Finally, I update the Dnsmasq's host configuration to listen on port 5353 instead 53. If at any point, I need to remove Pi-Hole, the only setting to revert is this `port` option.

```console
$ sudo sed -i -e 's/^port=53$/^port=5353$/g' /etc/dnsmasq.d/main.conf
```

I restart Dnsmasq and starts the Pi-Hole container

```console
$ sudo systemctl restart dnsmasq
$ docker-compose -f /opt/docker/pihole/docker-compose.yml up -d

-- Check the logs to ensure Pi-Hole is started properly
$ docker-compose -f /opt/docker/pihole/docker-compose.yml logs -f
```

Once started, I can access the Pi-Hole administration on `http://pisin.local/admin/`

## IPv6 hostnames detection

You may notice most of the IPv6 addresses used by the clients are not resolved in Pi-Hole. The reason is the clients prefer to use a temporary generated IP instead the one assigned by the DHCPv6 server. This behavior is called IPv6 Privacy extensions and is enabled by default on almost all operating systems.

![Je t'appelle en masquÃ©!]({{site.baseurl}}/img/20191013/pi-hole-top-clients_thumb.jpg)

It's really useful to resolve the names to identify quickly the clients so I ended up with a workaround. When a client join my network, it requests an IP to my DHCPv4 server and Dnsmasq stores the MAC address, the assigned IP and the hostname in a leases file. At the same time, the clients creates several IPv6 addresses and send a Neighbor Solicitation message for the configuration. Using `tcpdump`, I monitor this kind of message and when a NS is received, I try to find a client hostname matching the MAC address in the Dnsmasq leases file. Then I update a hosts file with the IPv6 addresses and the guessed hostnames (I append `-6` suffix to the hostnames to avoid any collision with the original Dnsmasq leases file).

I embedded the script in a small Docker container so it's easier to control and manage.

```bash
$ mkdir /opt/docker/snifipv6

$ tee /opt/docker/snifipv6/ipv6-to-hosts.sh > /dev/null << "EOF"
#!/bin/bash

# Path to Dnsmasq lease file
# e.g. /var/lib/misc/dnsmasq.leases
DNSMASQ_LEASES=$1

# Path to the hosts file to maintain
HOSTS=$2

# Extra delay to wait after a NS message is received
# to ensure the client is registered in the Dnsmasq leases file
WAIT=3

if !([ -p /dev/stdin ]); then
  echo "Only pipe input is supported"
  exit -1
fi

if !([ -r ${DNSMASQ_LEASES} ]); then
  echo "Source file ${DNSMASQ_LEASES} is not readable"
  exit -1
fi

touch ${HOSTS} > /dev/null 2>&1
if !([ -w ${HOSTS} ]); then
  echo "Output file ${HOSTS} is not writeable"
  exit -1
fi

echo "Using source '${DNSMASQ_LEASES}' and output '${HOSTS}'"

while read LINE; do
  echo "Received packet: ${LINE}"
  echo "Wait ${WAIT} seconds"
  sleep ${WAIT}

  MAC=$(echo $LINE | cut -d " " -f 2)
  IPV6=$(echo $LINE | cut -d " " -f 18 | sed 's/,$//')
  echo "Found MAC=${MAC} and IPv6=${IPV6}"

  if [[ ${IPV6} = fe80* ]]; then
    echo -e "Local link detected. Skip\n"
    continue
  fi

  HOSTNAME=$(grep -E "[0-9]+ $MAC" ${DNSMASQ_LEASES} | cut -d " " -f 4)
  if [ -z "${HOSTNAME}" ]; then
    echo -e "MAC not found in ${DNSMASQ_LEASES}. Skip\n"
    continue
  fi

  if [ "${HOSTNAME}" = "*" ]; then
    echo "Hostname '*' found in ${DNSMASQ_LEASES}. Skip\n"
    continue
  fi

  echo "Found matching hostname: ${HOSTNAME}"
  DATE=$(date --utc +%FT%TZ)
  LEASE_LINE="${IPV6} ${HOSTNAME}-6"
  LEASE_LINE_DATE="${LEASE_LINE} # ${DATE}"

  LEASE_EXIST=$(grep -E "${LEASE_LINE}" ${HOSTS})
  if [ $? -eq 0 ]; then
    echo -e "Updating lease\n"
    sed -Ei "s/${LEASE_LINE}.+$/${LEASE_LINE_DATE}/g" ${HOSTS}
  else
    echo -e "Adding lease\n"
    echo "${LEASE_LINE_DATE}" >> ${HOSTS}
  fi
done
EOF
```

This script can be tested with the following command line:
```console
$ sudo tcpdump -i eth0 -e -n 'ip6[40]=135 and src host ::' -l | \
>  bash /opt/docker/snifipv6/ipv6-to-hosts.sh \
>  /var/lib/misc/dnsmasq.leases \
>  /tmp/hosts-test
```

The script output looks like

```console
Using source '/var/lib/misc/dnsmasq.leases' and output '/tmp/hosts-test'
tcpdump: verbose output suppressed, use -v or -vv for full protocol decode

```

I create a Dockerfile and build the image

```
$ tee /opt/docker/snifipv6/Dockerfile > /dev/null << "EOF"
FROM alpine:latest
MAINTAINER Gregoire Pailler <gregoire@pailler.fr>

VOLUME  [ "/data/in", "/data/out" ]
RUN apk add --no-cache tcpdump bash

COPY ipv6-to-hosts.sh /ipv6-to-hosts.sh

ENTRYPOINT /usr/sbin/tcpdump -i eth0 -e -n 'ip6[40]=135 and src host ::' -l | bash /ipv6-to-hosts.sh /data/in/leases /data/out/hosts
EOF

-- Build the image
$ docker build -t snifipv6 /opt/docker/snifipv6
```

I configure a `docker-compose.yml` file
```console 
$ tee /opt/docker/snifipv6/docker-compose.yml > /dev/null << EOF
version: "3"

services:
  snifipv6:
    container_name: snifipv6
    image: snifipv6:latest
    volumes:
      - '/var/lib/misc/dnsmasq.leases:/data/in/leases_source:ro'
      - './data/:/data/out/'
    network_mode: "host"
    restart: unless-stopped
EOF

$ docker-compose -f /opt/docker/snifipv6/docker-compose.yml up -d
```

And finally, I update the Dnsmasq configuration to use this new `hosts` file. I use the `hostsdir` option so Dnsmasq will detect changes in the file and will update the hosts records dynamically. 
```
$ sudo echo "hostsdir=/opt/docker/snifipv6/data/" >> /etc/dnsmasq.d/main.conf

$ sudo systemctl restart dnsmasq
```
