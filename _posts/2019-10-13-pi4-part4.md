[Pi-Hole](https://pi-hole.net/) is a custom DNS server mainly used to block advertisements. Once installed, it acts as the standard DNS server for the whole network and you don't need to configure any adblock plugin on your devices.

Pi-Hole will be the default DNS server on the network but we will not use its DHCP capabilities. The goal is to keep the original Dnsmasq instance for DHCP and as an upstream server for DNS resolution. This way, it's easier to revert to a configuration without Pi-Hole with few changes.

## Pi-Hole configuration

Start by creating a `docker-compose.yml` file with the following content

```console
$ export PASSWORD=password
$ export HOST_IP4=192.168.1.2
$ export HOST_IP6=2404:e801:xxxx:xxxx::1681:2

$ mkdir /opt/docker/pihole && cd /opt/docker/pihole
$ tee docker-compose.yml > /dev/null << EOF
version: "3"

services:
  pihole:
    container_name: pihole
    image: pihole/pihole:latest
    ports:
      - 53:53/udp
      - 53:53/tcp
      - 60080:80/tcp # To remove if you use Nginx as a proxy (part6)
    environment:
      - TZ=Asia/Singapore
      - WEBPASSWORD=${PASSWORD}
      - DNS1=172.17.0.1#5353
      - DNS2=no
      - ServerIP=${HOST_IP4}
      - ServerIPv6=${HOST_IP6}
    volumes:
      - ./config/pihole/:/etc/pihole/
      - ./config/dnsmasq.d/:/etc/dnsmasq.d/
    dns:
      - 127.0.0.1 # Required for local names resolution
      - 1.1.1.1 # Required during startup when Pi-Hole is not fully started
    restart: unless-stopped

networks:
  default:
    external:
      name: br0
EOF

$ chmod o-r docker-compose.yml
```

Update the Dnsmasq's host configuration to listen on port 5353 instead of 53. If at any point, we need to remove Pi-Hole, the only setting to revert is this `port` option.

```console
$ sudo sed -i -e 's/^port=53$/^port=5353$/g' /etc/dnsmasq.d/main.conf
```

Restart Dnsmasq and starts the Pi-Hole container

```console
$ sudo systemctl restart dnsmasq
$ docker-compose up -d

-- Check the logs to ensure Pi-Hole is started properly
$ docker-compose logs -f
```

Once started, You can access the Pi-Hole administration on [http://pi.hole:60080/admin/](http://pi.hole:60080/admin/)

## IPv6 hostnames discovery

You may notice most of the IPv6 addresses used by the clients are not resolved in Pi-Hole. The reason is the clients prefer to use a temporary generated IP instead of the one assigned by the DHCPv6 server. This behavior is called IPv6 Privacy extensions and is enabled by default on almost all operating systems.

![Je t'appelle en masquÃ©!]({{site.baseurl}}/img/201910/pi-hole-top-clients_thumb.jpg)

It's really useful to resolve the names to identify quickly the clients so I ended up with a kind of hack. When a client joins the network, it requests an IP to the DHCPv4 server and Dnsmasq stores the MAC address, the assigned IP and the hostname in a leases file. At the same time, the client creates several IPv6 addresses and sends a Neighbor Solicitation message for the configuration. Using `tcpdump`, I monitor this kind of message and when a NS is received, I try to find a client hostname matching the MAC address in the Dnsmasq leases file. Then I update a hosts file with the IPv6 addresses and the guessed hostnames (I append `-6` suffix to the hostnames to avoid any collision with the original Dnsmasq leases file).

The script will run in a Docker container so it's easier to control and manage.

{: .box-note}
I published the docker image of `snifipv6` on Docker Hub so you can jump to the docker-compose.yml section if you just want to set up the container and use `gpailler/snifipv6:latest` image name.
The code is available on GitHub [https://github.com/gpailler/snifipv6](https://github.com/gpailler/snifipv6)


```bash
$ mkdir /opt/docker/snifipv6

$ tee ipv6-to-hosts.sh > /dev/null << "EOF"
#!/bin/bash

# Path to Dnsmasq lease file
# e.g. /var/lib/misc/dnsmasq.leases
DNSMASQ_LEASES=$1

# Path to the hosts file to create and maintain
HOSTS=$2

# Extra delay to wait after a NS message is received
# to ensure the client is registered in the Dnsmasq leases file
WAIT=3

if !([ -p /dev/stdin ]); then
  echo "Only pipe input is supported"
  exit -1
fi

if !([ -r ${DNSMASQ_LEASES} ]); then
  echo "Source file ${DNSMASQ_LEASES} is not readable"
  exit -1
fi

touch ${HOSTS} > /dev/null 2>&1
if !([ -w ${HOSTS} ]); then
  echo "Output file ${HOSTS} is not writeable"
  exit -1
fi

echo "Using source '${DNSMASQ_LEASES}' and output '${HOSTS}'"

while read LINE; do
  echo "Received packet: ${LINE}"
  echo "Wait ${WAIT} seconds"
  sleep ${WAIT}

  MAC=$(echo $LINE | cut -d " " -f 2)
  IPV6=$(echo $LINE | cut -d " " -f 18 | sed 's/,$//')
  echo "Found MAC=${MAC} and IPv6=${IPV6}"

  if [[ ${IPV6} = fe80* ]]; then
    echo -e "Local link detected. Skip\n"
    continue
  fi

  HOSTNAME=$(grep -E "[0-9]+ $MAC" ${DNSMASQ_LEASES} | cut -d " " -f 4)
  if [ -z "${HOSTNAME}" ]; then
    echo -e "MAC not found in ${DNSMASQ_LEASES}. Skip\n"
    continue
  fi

  if [ "${HOSTNAME}" = "*" ]; then
    echo "Hostname '*' found in ${DNSMASQ_LEASES}. Skip\n"
    continue
  fi

  echo "Found matching hostname: ${HOSTNAME}"
  DATE=$(date --utc +%FT%TZ)
  LEASE_LINE="${IPV6} ${HOSTNAME}-6"
  LEASE_LINE_DATE="${LEASE_LINE} # ${DATE}"

  LEASE_EXIST=$(grep -E "${LEASE_LINE}" ${HOSTS})
  if [ $? -eq 0 ]; then
    echo -e "Updating lease\n"
    sed -Ei "s/${LEASE_LINE}.+$/${LEASE_LINE_DATE}/g" ${HOSTS}
  else
    echo -e "Adding lease\n"
    echo "${LEASE_LINE_DATE}" >> ${HOSTS}
  fi
done
EOF
```

This script can be tested with the following command line:
```console
$ sudo tcpdump -i eth0 -e -n 'ip6[40]=135 and src host ::' -l | \
>  bash /opt/docker/snifipv6/ipv6-to-hosts.sh \
>  /var/lib/misc/dnsmasq.leases \
>  /tmp/hosts-test
```

When executing the command above, the output looks like:

```console

```

Create a `Dockerfile` and build the image

```
$ tee Dockerfile > /dev/null << "EOF"
FROM alpine:latest

VOLUME  [ "/data/in", "/data/out" ]
RUN apk add --no-cache tcpdump bash

COPY ipv6-to-hosts.sh /ipv6-to-hosts.sh

ENTRYPOINT /usr/sbin/tcpdump -i eth0 -e -n 'ip6[40]=135 and src host ::' -l | bash /ipv6-to-hosts.sh /data/in/leases /data/out/hosts
EOF

-- Build the image
$ docker build -t snifipv6 .
```

Create a `docker-compose.yml` file

```console 
$ tee /opt/docker/snifipv6/docker-compose.yml > /dev/null << EOF
version: "3"

services:
  snifipv6:
    container_name: snifipv6
    # Use gpailler/snifipv6:latest if you want to use the published image
    image: snifipv6:latest
    volumes:
      - /var/lib/misc/dnsmasq.leases:/data/in/leases_source:ro
      - ./data/:/data/out/
    network_mode: host
    restart: unless-stopped
EOF

$ docker-compose -f /opt/docker/snifipv6/docker-compose.yml up -d
```

And finally, update the Dnsmasq configuration to use this new `hosts` file. With the `hostsdir` option, Dnsmasq will detect the changes in the file and will update the hosts records dynamically. 

```
$ echo "hostsdir=/opt/docker/snifipv6/data/" | sudo tee -a /etc/dnsmasq.d/main.conf
$ sudo systemctl restart dnsmasq
```
