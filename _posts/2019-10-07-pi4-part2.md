title: Raspberry Pi 4 full configuration - part 2
subtitle: Custom DNS with Dnsmasq
tags: [raspberrypi, dnsmasq, IPv4, IPv6]
---

My Internet provider, StarHub, offers a nice 1 Gbps broadband access with full IPv4 and IPv6 support and a nice Linksys EA EA8100 router. The configuration options are really basic but it will fit my needs. The router will keep the DHCP task for IPv4 and the RA for IPv6 and I will only provide a custom DNS.

From my experience, keeping the DHCP and the routing on the router allows me to break everything on the Raspberry Pi while my family continue to enjoy Internet and it avoids screams, headaches and divorce (yes it can escalate quickly ;-) ).

I start by adding a DHCP reservation for the Pi
![I would like to book an address please]({{site.baseurl}}/img/20191007/rpi-dhcp-static_thumb.jpg)

I install `dnsmasq` and configure it to forward DNS queries to CloudFlare and Google DNS

```shell
$ sudo apt install dnsmasq

$ sudo tee /etc/dnsmasq.d/main.conf > /dev/null << EOF
# Listen on this standard DNS port
port=53

# Never forward plain names (without a dot or domain part)
domain-needed

# Never forward addresses in the non-routed address spaces.
bogus-priv

# Don't read /etc/resolv.conf or any other file.
# Use only the configuration provided by this file.
no-resolv

# Don't poll changes from external files (like /etc/resolv.conf)
no-poll

# Upstream DNS servers
server=2606:4700:4700::1001
server=2001:4860:4860::8844
server=1.1.1.1
server=8.8.8.8

# Ensure we use servers in order
strict-order

# Listen to a specific interface only
interface=eth0
bind-interfaces

# Increase the cachesize (the default value is 150)
cache-size=1500

# Don't store in cache the invalid resolutions
no-negcache

# Used to test our configuration later
address=/testdomain.tld/1.2.3.4
EOF

$ sudo systemctl restart dnsmasq
```

Finally, I assign my DNS server as a static DNS on the router
![Use this way please...]({{site.baseurl}}/img/20191007/rpi-dhcp-dns_thumb.jpg)

It's time to check our configuration. On the Pi, I install `radvdump` to retrieve the IPv6 RA messages and the published DNS server.

```shell
$ sudo apt install radvdump

$ sudo radvdump
[After few seconds]
interface eth0
{
        [SNIP]

        RDNSS 2404:e801:XXXX:XXXX:XXXX:XXXX:XXXX:XXXX
        {
                AdvRDNSSLifetime 300;
        };
};
```

Let's check that our test domain is properly resolved to confirm we're using our own DNS server.

```shell
$ sudo apt install dnsutils

-- Check the IPv4 DNS server provided by the router (it's still `192.168.1.1` in the DHCP leases)
$ dig @192.168.1.1 testdomain.tld A +short
1.2.3.4

-- Check the IPv6 DNS server provided by the router (published by the RDNSS option)
$ dig @2404:e801:XXXX:XXXX:XXXX:XXXX:XXXX:XXXX testdomain.tld A +short
1.2.3.4
```

Everything is working. The Linksys router forward the DNS queries to our Dnsmasq server.
